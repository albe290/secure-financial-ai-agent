# Governed Agentic AI Platform for Financial Workflow Automation

## Overview

This project is a production-oriented agentic AI platform designed to automate financial workflow decisioning with strong governance, human oversight, and operational visibility. Rather than acting as a simple AI assistant, the platform separates intake, context enrichment, deterministic control-plane decisions, strategy routing, bounded agent execution, runtime guardrails, human review, audit logging, evaluation, and dashboard visibility into clear architectural layers.

---

## Problem Statement

Financial workflows often suffer from manual bottlenecks, inconsistent escalation decisions, low auditability, weak review controls, and limited visibility into where automation is safe. Basic AI agents may generate useful output, but without deterministic controls, runtime safeguards, and review workflows, they are difficult to trust in regulated environments.

This platform addresses that gap by treating AI as a governed decision system rather than a standalone model workflow.

---

## Pain Points Solved

This platform addresses several common problems in regulated financial AI workflows:

- Manual review bottlenecks that slow operational throughput
- Inconsistent routing and escalation decisions across analysts or workflows
- Unsafe AI automation without deterministic governance boundaries
- Poor visibility into why a case was automated, reviewed, escalated, or blocked
- Weak traceability for audit, compliance, and post-incident analysis
- Limited human oversight for high-risk or customer-impacting decisions
- Low operational visibility into queue depth, review backlog, policy activity, and runtime outcomes
- Lack of measurable evaluation signals to improve governance and automation quality over time

---

## Business Value

This platform is designed to create measurable business and operational value by:

- Safely automating lower-risk work to reduce manual effort
- Escalating higher-risk cases earlier through deterministic controls
- Improving consistency of routing and policy-driven decisions
- Strengthening review quality with structured packets and evidence-backed recommendations
- Improving auditability through end-to-end trace logging
- Increasing operator visibility through dashboards and scorecards
- Supporting more responsible AI adoption in regulated enterprise workflows

---

## Architecture Philosophy

This project is designed as a governed AI decision platform rather than a standalone AI app.

The architecture separates:
- **Intake** — standardized request normalization
- **Context & Retrieval** — evidence assembly and enrichment
- **Control Plane** — deterministic validation, risk scoring, and policy mapping
- **Strategy Routing** — rules-based path selection
- **Bounded Agent Execution** — AI agents with scoped responsibilities
- **Runtime Governance** — step limits, budgets, retry controls
- **Human Review** — structured oversight for elevated-risk cases
- **Audit & Evaluation** — immutable trace and quality scorecards
- **Dashboard Visibility** — real-time operational console

This separation allows the platform to balance safe autonomy, explainability, scalability, and human oversight.

## End-to-End Workflow

```
1. An inbound request or event enters the platform
2. Intake normalizes the request into a standard contract
3. Context and retrieval assemble supporting evidence and business context
4. The control plane validates input, scores risk, and maps policy boundaries
5. The strategy router selects the correct governed path
6. Agents perform bounded analysis or execution tasks
7. Runtime guardrails enforce safe execution limits
8. High-risk or sensitive cases are routed to human review
9. Audit traces, evaluation metrics, and dashboard panels are updated
```

## Demo Walkthrough

This project solves the problem of unsafe and opaque automation in financial workflows.

I designed it as a governed agentic AI platform rather than a basic AI app. Requests enter through a standardized intake layer, context is assembled through retrieval and enrichment, and the control plane applies deterministic validation, risk scoring, and policy boundaries before any execution happens.

From there, the strategy router selects the appropriate path: automate, review, escalate, or block. Agents then perform bounded tasks inside runtime guardrails. If a case is high-risk, incomplete, or sensitive, it is routed into a human review workflow. Throughout the process, the platform records audit traces, evaluation signals, and operational metrics that feed the dashboard.

The result is a platform that supports safe autonomy, stronger oversight, and clearer operational visibility in a regulated environment.

## Platform Quality: Test Results

```
======================== 45 passed in 0.49s ========================

Unit Tests:         24 passed  (Control Plane, Strategy, Event Models)
Integration Tests:   9 passed  (End-to-End, Review Path, Event Pipeline)
Failure Tests:      12 passed  (Malformed Input, Policy Violations, Missing Context)
```

> The failure test suite discovered a real governance gap: the risk engine was auto-approving requests with empty customer context. The fix was deployed immediately — missing context now scores as elevated risk.
